# CTF Folder

Hello everyone, this is the folder I use to keep track of capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges that I complete. In each folder is a notes.md file. This is my personal log of what I did to complete the challenge. It's very useful for getting back into systems when my shell inevitably dies. I also use it as a reference for future challenges where the same tool or attack vector is used. These notes are often quickly written while scans are being run, so apologies for any spelling or grammar mistakes.

I removed all of the payloads, scripts, and other random files to keep the repository clean.

I have attempted to remove all active Hack The Box notes, as well as any flags. Please contact me if you spot something I've missed.


## CTF Setup Files

*ctf_template.sh* is a bash script that sets up a CTF folder as well as exporting the $IP variable and adding the IP to the /etc/hosts file.

*notes_template.md* is a file copied into new CTF folders. It is seperated into 4 sections, scans, enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation, the commen steps taken during a CTF.

*checklist_template.md* is the second file copied into new CTF folders. It is seperated by platform, then step, then category. For a thorough test, I would take each step for the relevant categories. In CTF's I mostly use it when I get stuck and need another attack vector. It is still under active development and may never be complete.
